Aaryn is a simple fake online store web application built with React. It allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and proceed to checkout or clear the cart entirely. The project uses CSS Modules for component-based styling.

## Description
Aaryn is a fictional shopping site that provides users with a simple, interactive shopping experience. Users can:
- Browse a catalog of items
- Add products to their cart
- View the cart contents
- Remove all items with one click
- Continue to a checkout screen
  
There is no login or registration required. The app is meant to demonstrate the shopping cart experience in an easy and approachable way.

## Design Phase
The design was first designed using Figma. When I was happy with the design I started the project in Visual Studio Code. The layout was styled using CSS Modules, for better organization and maintainability. I focused on a clean, minimal design.

## Development Phase
Aaryn was developed using plain React with JavaScript. Reactâ€™s state management was used to handle cart functionality and dynamic rendering of the UI across product, cart, and checkout pages.

### Built With
React (JavaScript)
CSS Modules

## Features
- Product listing page
- Add to cart functionality
- View and clear cart
- Proceed to checkout view

## Target Audience
Aaryn was created as a learning project to demonstrate a basic e-commerce flow. It's ideal for anyone exploring how online stores work or wanting to see a simplified shopping cart system in action.

## How to Use
Simply browse the products, add items to your cart, and either clear the cart or head to checkout. No login is required.
